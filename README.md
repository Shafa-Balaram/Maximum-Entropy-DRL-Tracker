# Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning Neural Tracker
The official implementation for training and testing for our paper [1] can be found at the [BICV Group repo](https://bitbucket.org/bicv/maximum-entropy-drl-tracker/src/master/). 
The tracker uses a variant of the soft actor-critic algorithm with options to fix the temperature parameter or enable automatic entropy tuning.
